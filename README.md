# RadTechZombies

A monster pack based off of the arsenal found in 'Radtech Weapon Pack'.
Monster code based off the work of MatthewTheGlutton, aka mc776, author of 'Hideous Destructor' for GZDoom.

**Requires the Radtech Weapon pack to function! It can be found at <https://github.com/swampyrad/RadTechWeaponsPack>**

List of monsters:

- 10mm Zombies:
Wields 10mm Pistols and Sig-Cows, slightly deadlier than SMG and Pistol Zombiemen.

- Doomed Jackboots:
Commonly known to wield Doomed Shotguns, their shots follow a much wider horizontal spread due to the lack of proper chokes.

- UAC Officers:
Wields Combat Shotguns, as high-ranking members of UAC's security forces, these guards are privileged to use lethal force. These blood-drenched goons wear body armor for better defense, but as a tradeoff they sacrifice semi-auto and side-saddles for a lighter weapon, resulting in slower firerate and taking longer to reload than usual, but are more agile and ruthless than the average jackboot.

- UAC Security:
Wields Less-Lethal Shotguns, lowly members of UAC's private security firm, their duties involve supervising transfers of company property and keeping civilians out of unauthorized areas. After falling victim to the invasion, these undead guards now roam the corridors looking for any "criminal scum" to bring swift justice to in the form of hardened rubber.

- Minerva Zombies:
Wields the Minerva 9mm Chaingun, has slower firerate, but unlike Vulcanette Zombies, they can be incapacitated.

- Elite Guards:
Female assassins carrying silenced Stens and pistols, they wait silently for their target, hoping to catch you off-guard.

- Melee and Brawler Zombies
Melee variants of the standard zombies, instead of shooting you, they want to beat you to a bloody pulp. Don't get cornered, or they can easily surround you if you're not careful.

- Wither
Undead Imp skeletons kept alive by demon magic. Weaker than normal imps, and more fragile. Falls apart when killed, and can't be revived.

- Zombie Dogs
These dogs didn't go to Heaven, now they're here to make your life Hell. Put them down quick before they tear you to bits. Watch out, some of them can be hard to spot...
