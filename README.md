# RadTechZombies
A monster pack addon for use with the 
RadTech Weapons Pack

WARNING: MUST BE LOADED AFTER RADTECH WEAPONS
OR ELSE IT WILL NOT WORK

Monster code based off the work of 
MatthewTheGlutton aka mc776, author
of the Hideous Destructor mod for GZDoom

List of monsters:

- 10mm Zombies:
Wields 10mm Pistols and Sig-Cows, slightly 
deadlier than SMG and Pistol Zombiemen.

- Doomed Jackboots:
Wields Doomed Shotguns, giving their shots 
a wider horizontal spread akin to their 
vanilla Doom counterparts.

- Combat Jackboots:
Wields Combat Shotguns, these blood-drenched 
goons wear body armor for better defense, but 
as a tradeoff they sacrifice semi-auto and 
side-saddles for mobility, resulting in slower
firerate and taking longer to reload than usual.

- Riot Police Jackboots:
Wields Less-Lethal Shotguns, members of UAC's
private security firm, these undead guards now
roam the corridors looking for any "criminal
scum" to bring swift justice to in the form of
hardened rubber.

- Minerva Zombies:
Wields the Minerva 9mm Chaingun, has slower 
firerate, but unlike Vulcanette Zombies, 
they can be incapacitated.
